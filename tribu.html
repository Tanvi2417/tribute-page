      <h2>Who Was Sambhaji Maharaj?</h2>
      <p>
        Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was the courageous son of the great Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Born in 1657, he was a brilliant scholar, fluent in multiple languages including Sanskrit, Persian, and Portuguese, and an expert in warfare and diplomacy. Despite facing immense challenges, he ascended to the throne after his father and bravely led the Maratha empire against the Mughals.

      <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>
        I admire Sambhaji Maharaj for his unmatched bravery and unwavering devotion to Swarajya and Dharma. His strength wasn’t just in battles, but also in his character. When captured by Aurangzeb, he endured unimaginable torture but refused to convert or betray his land and beliefs. His sacrifice is a reminder of the price our ancestors paid for our identity and freedom.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy That Lives Forever</h2>
      <p>
        Sambhaji Maharaj’s martyrdom at just 31 years of age is one of the most heroic chapters in Indian history. His life continues to inspire generations to fight for justice, truth, and national pride. His name echoes not just in forts and temples, but in the hearts of every proud Indian and Maratha.
      </p>

      <p>
        I bow to his courage, intellect, and supreme sacrifice. He will always remain a guiding light for me — a true Veer Yoddha, a protector of Dharma, and my eternal inspiration.
